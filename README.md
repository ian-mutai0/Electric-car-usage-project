# Electric-car-usage-project by Ian Mutai
This research project was about electric car usage using the Autolib dataset. The following steps were taken while drafting the report: 
## 1. Defining the Problem Statement
Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.

## 2. Understanding the data
As Data Scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company, I have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time.

## 3. Data Preparation
1. Load the URL to use the Autolib dataset
2. Check for invalid columns
3. Check for data accuracy
4. Check whether the data is complete
5. Check for duplicates and drop them
6. Check for uniformity

## 4. Data Analysis
We went ahead to analyze and determine the most popular hours for either picking or dropping the electric cars

## 5. Recommendation
We went ahead to give out our recommendations for the project
